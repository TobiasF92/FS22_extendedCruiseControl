# Extended Cruise Control
Extended Cruise Control' expands the functionality of the vanilla cruise control.
A total of three speed memories are now available, which can be set individually.
For easier driving during special work, it is now also possible to use permanent cruise control, which is not switched off when the brake is applied and then accelerates back to the desired speed.
